vim-lua-david
=============

My collection of settings for working with lua.

Lots of snippets in here may be useful to others (especially the compilers),
but this is more a dump of my config than it is a useful plugin for other
people.

I run lua:

* with lua.exe
* with love2d
* within a custom engine

I edit lua with:

* vim-lsp and sumneko lsp
* ale and luacheck
* my [fork of stevedonovan/ltags](https://github.com/idbrii/ltags)
* my [fork of xolox/vim-lua-ftplugin](https://github.com/idbrii/vim-lua-ftplugin)
* [lua testy](https://github.com/siffiejoe/lua-testy) for unit tests

# Load lua in vim (plugins)

See lib/ for how to setup vim to support `:lua` on Windows.
